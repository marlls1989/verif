Formal Verification
========================

This repository holds classwork for a graduated fomal verifical class, lectured in 2019 as part of my PhD program.

It contains the tasks performed for each subject cover in the lectures.
On these lectures, the students were invited to learn and use Cadence Jasper, a powerful formal verification tool.
Each subfolder contains a simple example, except for the submodule hf-risc.
On this submodule, the student included formal property verification to cover the multiplier unit, register bank and instruction fetching of a RISCV processor.
